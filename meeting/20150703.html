Group Meeting - Literature Review of Social Annotation & Pilot Study
===============

#### 2015.07.03 ####

---
## Social Annotation
* An example of social sensemaking.
* Augement search, recommendation, collaborative learning by these user-created metadata.
* Social summaries in class are useful to learning. (Kalnikaite and Whittaker, 2008)
* Social annotation accumulated by online users help individuals perfom better on sensemaking tasks. (Kitter, 2014)
* Many kinds of forms: tags, notes, highlightings ... etc.
* More work is needed to organize the literature.

---
## Second Language Listening and Annotation
* Listener characteristics on L2 listening comprehension: <br>
working memory, metacognitive strategies, L2 proficiency and experience, anxiety
* Problems L2 listerner usually faced: <br>
cognitive load, lack of linguistic, sociolinguistic and content knowledge.
* If L2 listeners are able to successfully employ a metacognitive strategy for determing when to take notes and when not to take notes, note taking can benefit listening comprehension.
* Annotation could serve as a marker that help listener to grep the key point of the passage.<br>
.green[⇒] lower down the cognitive load by using annotations as an external memory system<br>
.green[⇒] make listener use more effective strategies (no need to identifying key words)

## Pilot Study
* **Goal**: to understand whether there's differences between the highlighting patterns of NS and NNS while doing annotation for themselves and doing annotation for others.
* **Participants**: 4 NNS and 4 NS
* **Condition**: 2 (within: for others/for oneself) * 2 (between: NS/NNS)
* **Materials**: TedTalk audio (< 6 mins) + transcript (a pdf file)

---
## Pilot Study - Procedure
* Instructions
* Listen to the audio clip and do annotation in the same time.
* Listen to the audio clip again and modify the annotation (if they want)

##Questions
* Could they modify annotation after they finish listening?
* If the purpose is to make good helping transcript, then perhaps they could feel free to pause and play the audio clip themselves?

---
## Future work
* Find some L2 listener to evaluate whether the helping transcript is helpful.
* How should L2 listener read the helping transcipt? (How to display?) <br>
They need to read the transcript and the annotation together in a short time constraint (while listening).
* The scenario?
