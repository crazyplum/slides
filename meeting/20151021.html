Experiment Design<br>  (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
===============

## Introduction
* In audio conference, NNS may encounter many problems due to low language level.<br>
* Previous studies showed that ASR could improve NNS's comprehension during the communication. In interactive communication, sharing ASR between both NS and NNS could facilitate their conversational interaction.[1]
* However, NS faced problems while trying to follow the ASR and the conversation at the same time because there's delay and error in ASR.
* Annotation is a strategy people would use when they're reading.<br>
Different annotation types are helpful for different kinds of cognitive functions.[2]
* During audio conferences, NS have more cognitive resources and processing time. <br>
 If they could do annotation during the conference, perhaps their annotation could help NNS to follow up or grep the key points of the ongoing conversation.<br>
Also, annotation could be regarded as a note-taking tool for them in the audio conference. .green[(incentive for NS to do annotation)]

## Condition

.img-70[![alt text](img/condition1.png)]

* Two NS would annotate ASR for their own need, but we also told them highlight to help NNS.<br>
NNS would see the merged annoation of these two NS.
*

## Hypothesis
ASR with annotation could improve NNS's comprehension in audio conference. (because annotation could lower their cognitive load and make them feel more confident) <br>
⇒ NNS would speak up more. <br>
⇒ Group communication quality would be improved as well.<br>

## Task
* finding commonality task
    + The group need to find out as many commonalities as possible. 
    + We define commonalities here to be things that two people in the group share in common.
* post-task: 
    + write down commonalities from memory
    + check the transcript(either annotated) and wrire down commonalities they forgot.
* dependent Variables: cognitive load, NNS comprehension, user-experience
* screen, voicd records

---
## Measures
* Dependent variables
  + Workload   (Task Load Index/NASA-TLX)
  + Quality of group communication
  + Collaboration Experience
  + Talkativeness (may affect impression and quality)
---
## Measures
* Usablity of annotation (to NNS)
  + Annotation helps me get the idea what others people were talking about.
  + Annotation helps me find the sentence I was looking for.
  + preference, usefulness, willingness ....
* Benefits of annotating
  + Annotating helps me organize the whole discussion.
  + preference, usefulness, willingness ....

---
## Results
* We exclude groups that has low annotation usage rate.
* NS's workload significantly increased while NNS decreased in highlight condition.
* Group communication quality (clarity) significantly improved for all participants, while NNS improved more.
* Group communication quality (comfort) marginally significantly improved for all participants.
* The precentage of memorized commonalities increased for all participants in highlight condition, especially NS.
