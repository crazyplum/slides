Skype Meeting - ╰( ･ ᗜ ･ )╯

## Motivation
* NNS (Non native speakers) may encounter many problems during audio conferences with NS (native speaker).
* ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) may be useful to help them comprehend the ongoing conversation.
* However, reading transcirpt and listening in the same time may cost high cogntive load.
* Moreover, there's delay and error in ASR. <br>
NNS sometimes would get lost and couldn't find the sentence they want to read.
* Annotation may be helpful to help them.

---
## Related Work
* Social Annotation
* ASR support for NNS
---
## Annotation<!-- TODO:  -->
* when reading, annotation is helpful to certain kinds of cognitive functions.
---
## Social Annotation Redefined
* There's no consistent defintion of social annotations.
* Perhaps there are three types of annotations in the field.
---
## 1. crowdsourced annotations
* Readers wouldn't know that their annotations would be shared.
* Annotations are just **bymaterials** of their reading process.
* Bradshaw and Light found that readers exhibit a high degree of overlap in the passages they annotate. [1]
* Crowdsourced annotations perhaps could be helped to build recommendation model.

---
## 2. shared annotations
* Readers know that their annotations would be shared, and they know their annotations would somehow be rendered and displayed to other readers in community.
* People may share quotes to their social network.

---
## 3. collaborative annotations
* Readers know their annotations would be used as **materials** to discuss and collaborate with others.
* synchronous and asyncrhoronous collaboration
* There should be goal for the collaboration, eg: writing, discussion in class

## ASR support for NNS <!-- TODO:  -->

## Research Question <!-- TODO:  -->
---
## Experiment Design (Draft) <!-- TODO:  -->
* Task: brainstorming task + summary
  * Both NS and NNS has equality to speak up.
  * NS also have motivation to do annotation.
