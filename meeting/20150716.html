## Ongoing Project
1. Using annotation to support NNS reading (CSC Lab)
2. Using ASR (Automated speech recognition) and annotation to support NNS in audio conference with NS. (NTT)
---
## Motivation
* NNS (Non native speakers) may encounter many problems during audio conferences with NS (native speaker).
* ASR may be useful to help them comprehend the ongoing conversation.
* However, reading transcirpt and listening in the same time may cost high cogntive load.
* Moreover, there's delay and error in ASR. <br>
NNS sometimes would get lost and couldn't find the sentence they want to read.
* Annotation may be helpful to help them.

---
## Related Work
* Social Annotation
* ASR support for NNS
---
## Annotation
* When reading, different annotation types are helpful for different kinds of cognitive functions.
* For example, selection level annotations (e.g. highlighting, underlining) support encoding of factual knowledge. [1]
* ESL (English as second language) listener facing many problems such as cognitive load, lack of linguistic, sociolinguistic and content knowledge.
* Annotation could serve as a marker that help listener to grep the key point of the passage.<br>
.green[⇒] lower down the cognitive load by using annotations as an external memory system<br>
.green[⇒] make listener use more effective strategies (no need to identifying key words)

## Social Annotation Redefined
* There's no consistent defintion of social annotations in literatures.
* Perhaps there are three types of annotations in the field.
---
## 1. crowdsourced annotations
* Readers wouldn't know that their annotations would be shared.
* Annotations are just **bymaterials** of their reading process.
* Bradshaw and Light found that readers exhibit a high degree of overlap in the passages they annotate. [1]
* Crowdsourced annotations perhaps could be helped to build recommendation model.

## 2. shared annotations
* Readers know that their annotations would be shared, and they know their annotations would somehow be rendered and displayed to other readers in community.
* People may share quotes to their social network.

---
## 3. collaborative annotations
* Readers know their annotations would be used as **materials** to discuss and collaborate with others.
* synchronous and asyncrhoronous collaboration
* There should be goal for the collaboration, eg: writing, discussion in class.

## ASR support for NNS <!-- TODO:  -->
* Problems of ASR: error rates and delay
* Real-time transcripts(perfect transcripts) could improve NNS's comprehension perfomance significantly. [1]
* ASR would be marginally helpful to NNS if the error rate is lower than 20%. <br>
If the error rate of ASR is about 10%, there would be no significant difference improvement of comprehension when comparing with perfect transcription. [2]
* 2 seconds delay of transcript is endurable. [3]
* Previous studies also used highlighting to help NS and NNS catch up missed conversation. [4]
* Studies above focus on one-way CMC scenario.<br>
Need to survey more studies about two-way communication.

## Hypothesis (Draft) <!-- TODO:  -->
* Annotation would be helpful to both NNS and NS. (in what aspects?)
* The cognitive load of NNS could be decreased due to annotation.

---
## Experiment Design (Draft) <!-- TODO:  -->
* Condition: with/without annotation
* Participants: NS + NNS pair
* Task: brainstorming task + summary(post-task)
  * Both NS and NNS has equality to speak up.
  * NS also have motivation to do annotation.
* Dependent Variables: cognitive load, NNS comprehension, user-experience ... ?

---
## Details need to concern
* Should the annotation be public or private?
  * NNS may not want to annotate because they think their annoation is useless to NS.
* Other tasks?
