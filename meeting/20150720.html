## Experiment Design 
* Participants: 2NS + NNS triads
* Condition: Annotation shared manipulation <br>
NS think they annotate for themselves, (<br>
  1. merge and share to NNS: NNS would see the merged results of annotation
  2. one share, one not: NNS would only see one of the NS's annotation
  3. without annotation: baseline
* NNS don't need to do annotation and they're not allowed to take notes.

## Experiment Design
* Task
  * brainstorming .pink[(Title?)]
  * 2 stages of summary
      + First stage: write summary without annotation
      + Second stage: write summary with annotation
* Dependent Variables: cognitive load, NNS comprehension, user-experience ... ?
