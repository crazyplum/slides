## Progress
* Survey second language learning literature.
* Survey related works</br>
.orange[â‡’]Previous works focused on enhancing comprehension via improving vocabulary understanding.

## Description of Reading
Fluent Reading is ...
* .blue[Rapid]: The reader needs to maintainthe flow of informationat a sufficientrate to make connections and inferences vital to comprehension.
* .blue[Purposeful]: The reader has a purpose for reading, whether it is for entertainment, information, research, and so on.
* .blue[Interactive]: The reader makes use of information from his/her background knowledge as well as information from the printed page. Many skills work together simultaneously in the process.
* .blue[Comprehending]: The reader typically expects to understand what he is reading.
* .blue[Flexible]: The reader employs a range of strategies to read efficiently.The strategies include adjusting the reading speed, skimming ahead, considering titles, headings, pictures and text structure information, anticipating information to come, and so on.
* .blue[Developed gradually]: The reader does not become fluent suddenly, or immediately following a reading development course.

## Six Component Skills of Reading
1. Automatic recognition skills<br>
lexical access skills, low-level processing
2. Vocabulary and structural knowledge<br>
Fluent readers need a sound knowledge of language structure and a large recognition vocabulary.
3. Formal discourse structure knowledge<br>
knowing a text is organized influences the comprehension of the text. Write better and recall better.
4. Content/world background knowledge<br>
prior knowledge of text-related information, .pink[cultural knowledge]
5. Synthesis and evaluation skills/strategies<br>
predicting from the text
6. Metacognitive knowledge and skills monitoring<br>
knowledge about cognition and the self-regulatoin of cognition, .pink[strategies] to achieve specific goals

## Problems ESL readers meet
* L2 acquisitoin and training background differences, language processing differences and social context differences.
* L2 learners typically have not already learned a large store of oral language vocabulary; nor do they have a faairly complete sense of the grammar of the language.
* L2 learners have a more well-developed conceptual sense of the world; considerably more factual knowledge about the world, and they can make elaborate logical inferences from the text.
* Linguistic differences at syntactic and discourse levels are more likely to have an influence on reader comprehension.
* Different cultures may prefer different way of organizing information; thus, comprehension of texts may be culturally dependent accordign to th logical organization of the text.

---
## Back to the project ...
* Try to eliminate the .blue[culture effect] when reading materials.
* Previous work focused on improving vocabulary understanding, but the proposed project focused on improving .blue[comprehension].
* Could be framed as an interactive tutor-like community ?

---
## Icon Types
* Question marks: .img-adjust[![alt text](img/question.png)] .img-adjust[![alt text](img/question1.png)]
* Good point: .img-adjust[![alt text](img/like.png)]
* inspiring: .img-adjust[![alt text](img/inspired.png)] .img-adjust[![alt text](img/inspired1.png)]
* And more ... ?

---
## Pilot Study
* Test whether people would like to use stickers when reading?

---
##Next Step
* Survey more related works.
* Try to find whether there's community aim for reading support.
