Experiment Design<br>  (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
===============
---
## Introduction 
* In audio conference, NNS may encounter many problems due to low language level.<br>
* Previous studies showed that ASR could improve NNS's comprehension during the communication. In interactive communication, sharing ASR between both NS and NNS could facilitate their conversational interaction.[1]
* However, NS faced problems while trying to follow the ASR and the conversation at the same time because there's delay and error in ASR.
* Annotation is a strategy people would use when they're reading.<br>
Different annotation types are helpful for different kinds of cognitive functions.[2]
* During audio conferences, NS have more cognitive resources and processing time. <br>
 If they could do annotation during the conference, perhaps their annotation could help NNS to follow up or grep the key points of the ongoing conversation.<br>
Also, annotation could be regarded as a note-taking tool for them in the audio conference. .green[(incentive for NS to do annotation)]

## Condition
* Studies about annotation use while reading showed that there's a transition from personal annotation to collaborative annotation.<br>
People would try to render their annotations to make them intelligible to other reader.<br>
Thus, we proposed two conditions as followed to see how different scenario of annotating would affect group communication.

Two NS would annotate ASR for their own need.
NNS would see the merged annoation of these two NS.

All the group memebers would annotate on same ASR.

## Research Question

## Task
* storytelling task
    + Mister O comics * 3(any IP issues?)
    + choose 15 frames in each commics, so every participant would have 5 frames.
    + ask them to order the frames and tell a story together
* post-task: write a brief story summary
    + write summary without annotation
* dependent Variables: cognitive load, NNS comprehension, user-experience ... ?
* screen, voicd records

## Measures
* Dependent variables
  + Workload   (Task Load Index/NASA-TLX)
  + Quality of group communication
  + Impression of collaboration
  + Impression on their partner
  + Talkativeness (may affect impression and quality)
---
## Measures
* Usablity of annotation (to NNS)
  + Annotation helps me get the idea what others people were talking about.
  + Annotation helps me find the sentence I was looking for.
  + preference, usefulness, willingness ....
* Benefits of annotating
  + Annotating helps me organize the whole discussion.
  + preference, usefulness, willingness ....

## Procedure (about an hour)
1. Intro<br>
  1) storytelling task intro    (5-7 min)<br>
  2) software guide              (3-5 min)<br>
2. storytelling ing task            (.orange[15 min])  .red[(to be defined)]<br>
3. write summary                 (no limit time)   
4. post-experimental questionnaire (10 min)<br>
5. brief interview .blue[(if needed?)] (10 min)

---
## Pilot Study
* To check whether storytelling task works, and get familiar with the experiment setup.
* 2-3 groups of participants, one for each storytelling task.
