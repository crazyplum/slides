## Social Annotation Redefined
* There's no consistent defintion of social annotations.
* Perhaps there are three types of annotations in the field.
---
## 1. crowdsourced annotations
* Readers wouldn't know that their annotations would be shared.
* Annotations are just **bymaterials** of their reading process.
* Bradshaw and Light found that readers exhibit a high degree of overlap in the passages they annotate. [1]
* Crowdsourced annotations perhaps could be helped to build recommendation model.

## 2. shared annotations
* Readers know that their annotations would be shared, and they know their annotations would somehow be rendered and displayed to other readers in community.
* People may share quotes to their social network.

## 3. collaborative annoattions
* Readers know their annotations would be used as **materials** to discuss and collaborate with otehrs.
* synchronous and asyncrhoronous collaboration
* There should be goal for the collaboration, eg: writing, discussion in class
