Experiment Design<br> (ര̀ᴗര́)و ̑̑
===============
---
## Overview
* Scenario: NS and NNS in audio conferences
* NNS (Non native speakers) may encounter many problems during audio conferences with NS (native speaker) because they are lack of resources and processing time.
* ASR may be useful to help them comprehend the ongoing conversation.
* However, reading transcirpt and listening in the same time may cost high cognitive load.
There's usually delay and error in ASR, so NNS sometimes would get lost and couldn't spot the sentences or words they want to read.
* During audio conferences, NS have more cognitive resources and processing time. <br>
 If they could do annotation during the conference, perhaps their annotation could help NNS to follow up or grep the key points of the ongoing conversation.<br>
Also, annotation could be regarded as a note-taking tool for them in the audio conference. .green[(incentive for NS to do annotation)]
---
## Participants
* 2NS + NNS triads
* There are two NS in a group so that NNS may be easily left behind.

---
## Condition
* NS think they annotate for themselves <br>
* Annotation shared manipulation: <br>
  1. merge and share to NNS: NNS would see the merged results of annotation .blue[duplicate annotation has deeper color?]
  2. one share, one not: NNS would only see one of the NS's annotation
  3. without annotation: baseline
* NNS don't need to do annotation, and both NS and NSS are not allowed to take notes.
* .blue[When NS highlight a word or a sentence, there would be a notepad to record all their annotation?]

---
## Task
* [brainstorming task](http://crazyplum.github.io/slides/material/brainstorming_tasks.doc) [1] .pink[(need to translate to Japanese version)]
    + Extra Thumb
    + Extra Eye
    + Having Wings
* 2 stages of summary
    + First stage: write summary without annotation
    + Second stage: write summary with annotation
* Dependent Variables: cognitive load, NNS comprehension, user-experience ... ?
* .blue[Should we record monitor?]

## Procedure

---
## Pilot Study
* To check whether brainstorming task proper for the study.
* 3 groups of participants, one for each brainstorming task.
