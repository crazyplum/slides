## Condition
* Studies about annotation use while reading showed that there's a transition from personal annotation to collaborative annotation.<br>
People would try to render their annotations to make them intelligible to other reader.<br>
Thus, we proposed two conditions as followed to see how different scenario of annotating would affect group communication.
.left-column[
.img-70[![alt text](img/condition1.png)]
Two NS would annotate ASR for their own need.
NNS would see the merged annoation of these two NS.
]
.right-column[
.img-70[![alt text](img/condition2.png)]
All the group memebers would annotate on same ASR.
]

## Hypothesis
ASR with annotation could improve NNS's comprehension in audio conference. (because annotation could lower their cognitive load and make them feel more confident) <br>
⇒ NNS would speak up more. <br>
⇒ Group communication quality would be improved as well.<br>

## Task
* storytelling task
    + Mister O comics * 2(any IP issues?)
    + choose 15 frames in each commics, so every participant would have 5 frames.
    + ask them to order the frames and tell a story together
* post-task: write a brief story summary
    + write summary without annotation
* dependent Variables: cognitive load, NNS comprehension, user-experience ... ?
* screen, voicd records

## Measures
* Dependent variables
  + Workload   (Task Load Index/NASA-TLX)
  + Quality of group communication
  + Impression of collaboration
  + Impression on their partner
  + Talkativeness (may affect impression and quality)
---
## Measures
* Usablity of annotation (to NNS)
  + Annotation helps me get the idea what others people were talking about.
  + Annotation helps me find the sentence I was looking for.
  + preference, usefulness, willingness ....
* Benefits of annotating
  + Annotating helps me organize the whole discussion.
  + preference, usefulness, willingness ....

## Procedure (about an hour)
1. Intro<br>
  1) storytelling task intro    (5-7 min)<br>
  2) software guide              (3-5 min)<br>
2. storytelling ing task            (.orange[15 min])  .red[(to be defined)]<br>
3. write summary                 (no limit time)
4. post-experimental questionnaire (10 min)<br>
5. brief interview .blue[(if needed?)] (10 min)

---
## Pilot Study
* To check whether storytelling task works, and get familiar with the experiment setup.
* 2-3 groups of participants, one for each storytelling task.
