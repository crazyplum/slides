What we got so far<br> (ര̀ᴗര́)و ̑̑
===============
---
## Results we got - significance
* Workload (Condition*Type: t(31) = 2.05, p = 0.049), NS increased workload while NNS decreased workload.
* Group Communication quality - Clarity (Condition: t(31) = -2.51, p = 0.0174), improved NNS much more.
* Group Communication quality - Comfort (Condition*Type: t(31) = -2.03, p = 0.0514)
* Delete the group with low highlighting function usage (the lowest quartile)
* highlighting function usage: <br>
`$$\begin{align}&= \frac{highlighted \ once \times 1 + highlighted\ twice \times 2}{all \ ASR\ sentences} \\ &= \frac{annotations\ made\ by\ NS}{all\ ASR\ sentences}\end{align}$$`
---
## Number of commonalities
* Group commonalites found: union the answers of NS in two stages
`$$normalized \ commonalities =  \frac{memorized \ commonalites}{group \ commonalities  \ found} $$` 
Condition: t(29.24) = - 2.44, p = 0.02; Type: t(29.89) = -4.18, p < 0.01  (NS improved significantly)

* I also calculate the agreement of their answers, but there's no significance.
---
## From the interview (NS)
* Mostly they highlighted for NNS > self.
* Some felt highlighting distracting, while others felt it helpful.
* Few (three) native speakers reported that they changed their way of speaking because they want to highlight the sentences they said.
* Some said ASR errors affected their decision process while highlighting, while some said they didn't notice errors at all.<br>
-> Perhaps depends on the ASR accuracy.
* Some felt burden because they tried to think up ideas and highlighting at the same time.

## Next step?
* WER
* Conversation Analysis?
