What we got so far<br> (ര̀ᴗര́)و ̑̑
===============
---
## Results we got - significance
* Workload (Condition*Type: t(31) = 2.05, p = 0.049), NS increased workload while NNS decreased workload.
* Group Communication quality - Clarity (Condition: t(31) = -2.51, p = 0.0174), improved NNS much more.
* Group Communication quality - Comfort (Condition*Type: t(31) = -2.03, p = 0.0514)
* Delete the group with low highlighting function usage (the lowest quartile)
* highlighting function usage: <br>
`$$\begin{align}&= \frac{highlighted \ once \times 1 + highlighted\ twice \times 2}{all \ ASR\ sentences} \\ &= \frac{annotations\ made\ by\ NS}{all\ ASR\ sentences}\end{align}$$`
---
## Number of commonalities
* There is no any differences between two conditions.<br>
(NNS: 8.21(B) vs 8.71(H); NNS: 14.6(B) vs  14.3(H))
* Need to calculate percentage of answers they wrote down.<br>
(because they may find out quite different common things with different task topic)
* Union the answers of two stages (memorized + checked transcript)<br>
-> pretend to be the correct answers?
---
## From the interview (NS)
* Mostly they highlighted for NNS > self.
* Some felt highlighting distracting, while others felt it helpful.
* Few (three) native speakers reported that they changed their way of speaking because they want to highlight the sentences they said.
* Some said ASR errors affected their decision process while highlighting, while some said they didn't notice errors at all.<br>
-> Perhaps depends on the ASR accuracy.
* Some felt burden because they tried to think up ideas and highlighting at the same time.


---
## Next step?
* correct answer of each group in each task
* analyze the answers they wrote down: confilct, agreement .. etc.
* WER
