## Introduction
* In audio conference, NNS may encounter many problems due to low language level.<br>
* Previous studies showed that ASR could improve NNS's comprehension during the communication. In interactive communication, sharing ASR between both NS and NNS could facilitate their conversational interaction.[1]
* However, NS faced problems while trying to follow the ASR and the conversation at the same time because there's delay and error in ASR.
* Annotation is a strategy people would use when they're reading.<br>
Different annotation types are helpful for different kinds of cognitive functions.[2]
* During audio conferences, NS have more cognitive resources and processing time. <br>
 If they could do annotation during the conference, perhaps their annotation could help NNS to follow up or grep the key points of the ongoing conversation.<br>
Also, annotation could be regarded as a note-taking tool for them in the audio conference. .green[(incentive for NS to do annotation)]

## Hypothesis (´ﾟдﾟ`)
1.  With annotation tool, the group communication quality and collaboartaion experience would improve.
2. With annotation tool,<br>
  a. The workload of NS would increase.<br>
  b. The workload of NNS would decrease.
3.  With annotation tool,  participants could memorize more commonalites.
 
* Goal: enhance group collaboration in mix-language.

## Condition

.right-column[![alt text](img/condition1.png)]

.left-column[
* Highlighted Condition: Two NS would annotate ASR for their own need, but we also told them highlight to help NNS.<br>
NNS would see the merged annoation of these two NS. 
* Baseline Condition: They could read ASR but they couldn't annotate on it.

## Task
* finding commonality task
    + The group need to find out as many commonalities as possible. 
    + We define commonalities here to be things that two people in the group share in common.
* post-task: 
    + write down commonalities from memory
    + check the transcript(either annotated) and wrire down commonalities they forgot.


---
## Measures
* Dependent variables
  + Workload   (Task Load Index/NASA-TLX)
  + Quality of group communication (Clarity, Comfort, Responsiveness)
  + Collaboration experience
  + Recall commonalities percentage 

---
## Results
* We exclude groups that has low annotation usage rate.
* NS's workload significantly increased while NNS decreased in highlight condition.
* Group communication quality (clarity) significantly improved for all participants, while NNS improved more.
* Group communication quality (comfort) marginally significantly improved for all participants.
* The recall commonalities increased for all participants in highlight condition, especially NS.

---
## Discussion
* Why group communication quality(clarity, comfort) improved?
  + NNS are more confident in the highlighted condition.
  + Annotation let them confirm the key points.
  + From the interview, NNS feels the group focused on the task more in the highlighted condition. (not analyze yet)
* Why recall commonalites improved and especially NS?
  + Because NS need to process the information so they could memorize more.

---
## Questions
* Task secenario?
  + ice breaking in cross-lingual situation?
  + relationship building?
  + Why don't we use map navigation task in previous research?
    - Because we want to make NNS speak up and we want to have side talks to check whether they follow the conversation flow.
* Framing?
